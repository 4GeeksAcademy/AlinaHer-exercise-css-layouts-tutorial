Instructions

Hide the first <h2> element, but keep the space that it uses (use visibility rule for that).
Now hide the second <h2> but this time use display:none; to also release the area/space that it was using (the bottom content should move up).
Make the all the <li> elements of #myUL to display inline.
Make strong elements display as block elements (that will turn them into boxes).

Expected result:
