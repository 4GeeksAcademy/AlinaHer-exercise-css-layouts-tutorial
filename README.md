## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **index.css:** your CSS code goes here.
2. **index.html:** your HTML code goes here.
3. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
4. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
